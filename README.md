# CinemaPlatform

```
Welcome to CinemaPlatform, a Java-based platform designed for reviewing movies and TV series. With this platform, users can create accounts as CinemaGoers or ProductionCompanies to share their thoughts on various films and TV shows. Movie
enthusiasts can explore reviews, rate productions, and engage in discussions, while production companies can receive valuable feedback from 
their audience.
```
```
The connection to the database is established in Main.getConnection(). 
```
```
For the UserApp, CinemaGoer, Award, and Review objects, we have created CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) which are included in methods in MainService.
```
```
The application has an audit service (AuditService) that writes to an audit file (data/audit.csv, data/cinemagoer.csv, etc.).
